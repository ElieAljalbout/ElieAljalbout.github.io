I am a Ph.D. student and research assistant at the [Munich School of Robotics and Machine Intelligence](https://www.msrm.tum.de/en/rsi/team/research-assistants/aljalbout-elie/) of the Technical University of Munich. My research focus is at the intersection of machine learning, robotics and computer vision. I am particularly interested in representation learning for robot reinforcement learning.
